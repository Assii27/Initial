## History of Java

## Java Platforms
    - Java SE - Standard Edition
    Core java
    - Java EE - Enterprise Edition
    - Java ME - Micro Edition
    - Java Card

## SDK,JDK,JRE,JVM
- SDK - Software Development Kit
        - Developemnt Tools + Documentation + Libraries + RunTime Environment
- JDK - Java Development Kit
    - Developemnt Tools + Documentation + Libraries + RunTime Environment
- JRE - Java Runtime environment
        - rt.jar + JVM
- JVM - Java Virtual Machine
    An engine which helps to execute the java code.
    We can also call it as Execution Engine

## Datatypes
    - It defines 3 things
    1. Memory
        - How much memory is required to store that data.
    2. Nature
        - What kind of data i can store
    3. Operations
        - What all operations we can perform on these data

- Datatypes are classified into 2 types
    1. Primitive (value Type)
        byte,short,int,long,float,double,char,boolean

    2. Non Primitive (Reference Type)
        class,Array,Interface

## Wrapper classes
    - For every primitive datatype java have defined a class.
    - These clases are called as wrapper classes.
    - All wrapper classes are final classes
    - All wrapperclasses are declared in java.lang package

## Widening
    - a process of converting narrower type of data into wider type is called as widening
    - No need of explicit Typecasting

## Narrowing
    - a process of convertinf wider type oda data into narrower type is called as narrowing
    - It is a forced conversion.
    - Explicit Typecasting is required.

## Operators
    1. Arithmetic Operators
        +,-,*,/,%
    2. Unary Operators
        ++,--
    3. Relational Operators
        ==,!=,<,><=,=>
    4. Bitwise Operators
        &,|,~,^
    5. logical operators
        &&,||,!
    6. Assignment Operator
        =,+=,-+,*=,/=,%=
    7. Shift operator
        >>,<<
